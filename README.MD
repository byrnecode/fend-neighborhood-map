## A Project in the Udacity Frontend Web Developer Nanodegree Program
This is a single page application featuring a map of a neighborhood you would like to visit. This is an example on how design patterns assist in developing a manageable codebase. Explore how frameworks can decrease the time required developing an application and provide a number of utilities for a developer to use. Finally, implementing third-party APIs that provide valuable data sets that can improve the quality of an application.

## Project Focus
- Interacting with API servers
